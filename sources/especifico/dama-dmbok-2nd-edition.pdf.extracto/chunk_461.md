•
Timing issues (beyond timeliness itself): Is it stable yet responsive to legitimate change requests?
•
Flexibility: Is the data comparable and compatible with other data? Does it have useful groupings and
classifications? Can it be repurposed? Is it easy to manipulate?
•
Confidence: Are Data Governance, Data Protection, and Data Security processes in place? What is the
reputation of the data, and is it verified or verifiable?
•
Value: Is there a good cost / benefit case for the data? Is it being optimally used? Does it endanger
people’s safety or privacy, or the legal responsibilities of the enterprise? Does it support or contradict
the corporate image or the corporate message?
While there is not a single, agreed-to set of data quality dimensions, these formulations contain common ideas. 
Dimensions include some characteristics that can be measured objectively (completeness, validity, format 
conformity) and others that depend on heavily context or on subjective interpretation (usability, reliability, 
reputation). Whatever names are used, dimensions focus on whether there is enough data (completeness), 
whether it is right (accuracy, validity), how well it fits together (consistency, integrity, uniqueness), whether it 
is up-to-date (timeliness), accessible, usable, and secure. Table 29 contains definitions of a set of data quality 
dimensions, about which there is general agreement and describes approaches to measuring them.

Description 
Accuracy 
Accuracy refers to the degree that data correctly represents ‘real-life’ entities. Accuracy is difficult 
to measure, unless an organization can reproduce data collection or manually confirm accuracy of 
records. Most measures of accuracy rely on comparison to a data source that has been verified as 
accurate, such as a system of record or data from a reliable source (e.g., Dun and Bradstreet 
Reference Data). 
Completeness 
Completeness refers to whether all required data is present. Completeness can be measured at the 
data set, record, or column level. Does the data set contain all the records expected? Are records 
populated correctly? (Records with different statuses may have different expectations for 
completeness.) Are columns/attributes populated to the level expected? (Some columns are 
mandatory. Optional columns are populated only under specific conditions.) Assign completeness 
rules to a data set with varying levels of constraint: Mandatory attributes that require a value, data 
elements with conditional and optional values, and inapplicable attribute values. Data set level 
measurements may require comparison to a source of record or may be based on historical levels 
of population. 
Consistency 
Consistency can refer to ensuring that data values are consistently represented within a data set 
and between data sets, and consistently associated across data sets. It can also refer to the size and 
composition of data sets between systems or across time. Consistency may be defined between 
one set of attribute values and another attribute set within the same record (record-level 
consistency), between one set of attribute values and another attribute set in different records 
(cross-record consistency), or between one set of attribute values and the same attribute set within 
the same record at different points in time (temporal consistency). Consistency can also be used to 
refer to consistency of format. Take care not to confuse consistency with accuracy or correctness. 
Characteristics that are expected to be consistent within and across data sets can be used as the 
basis for standardizing data. Data Standardization refers to the conditioning of input data to ensure 
that data meets rules for content and format. Standardizing data enables more effective matching 
and facilitates consistent output. Encapsulate consistency constraints as a set of rules that specify 
consistent relationships between values of attributes, either across a record or message, or along 
all values of a single attribute (such as a range or list of valid values). For example, one might 
expect that the number of transactions each day does not exceed 105% of the running average 
number of transactions for the previous 30 days.
