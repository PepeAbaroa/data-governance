DATA QUALITY • 459 
Dimension of 
Quality 
Description 
Integrity 
Data Integrity (or Coherence) includes ideas associated with completeness, accuracy, and 
consistency. In data, integrity usually refers to either referential integrity (consistency between 
data objects via a reference key contained in both objects) or internal consistency within a data set 
such that there are no holes or missing parts. Data sets without integrity are seen as corrupted, or 
have data loss. Data sets without referential integrity have ‘orphans’ – invalid reference keys, or 
‘duplicates’ – identical rows which may negatively affect aggregation functions. The level of 
orphan records can be measured as a raw count or as a percentage of the data set.  
Reasonability 
Reasonability asks whether a data pattern meets expectations. For example, whether a distribution 
of sales across a geographic area makes sense based on what is known about the customers in that 
area. Measurement of reasonability can take different forms. For example, reasonability may be 
based on comparison to benchmark data, or past instances of a similar data set (e.g., sales from the 
previous quarter). Some ideas about reasonability may be perceived as subjective. If this is the 
case, work with data consumers to articulate the basis of their expectations of data to formulate 
objective comparisons. Once benchmark measurements of reasonability are established, these can 
be used to objectively compare new instances of the same data set in order to detect change. (See 
Section 4.5.)  
Timeliness 
The concept of data Timeliness refers to several characteristics of data. Measures of timeliness 
need to be understood in terms of expected volatility – how frequently data is likely to change and 
for what reasons. Data currency is the measure of whether data values are the most up-to-date 
version of the information. Relatively static data, for example some Reference Data values like 
country codes, may remain current for a long period. Volatile data remains current for a short 
period. Some data, for example, stock prices on financial web pages, will often be shown with an 
as-of-time, so that data consumers understand the risk that the data has changed since it was 
recorded. During the day, while the markets are open, such data will be updated frequently. Once 
markets close, the data will remain unchanged, but will still be current, since the market itself is 
inactive. Latency measures the time between when the data was created and when it was made 
available for use. For example, overnight batch processing can give a latency of 1 day at 8am for 
data entered into the system during the prior day, but only one hour for data generated during the 
batch processing. (See Chapter 8.) 
Uniqueness / 
Deduplication 
Uniqueness states that no entity exists more than once within the data set. Asserting uniqueness of 
the entities within a data set implies that a key value relates to each unique entity, and only that 
specific entity, within the data set. Measure uniqueness by testing against key structure. (See 
Chapter 5.) 
Validity 
Validity refers to whether data values are consistent with a defined domain of values. A domain of 
values may be a defined set of valid values (such as in a reference table), a range of values, or 
value that can be determined via rules. The data type, format, and precision of expected values 
must be accounted for in defining the domain. Data may also only be valid for a specific length of 
time, for example data that is generated from RFID (radio frequency ID) or some scientific data 
sets. Validate data by comparing it to domain constraints. Keep in mind that data may be valid 
(i.e., it may meet domain requirements) and still not be accurate or correctly associated with 
particular records.  
Figure 92 aligns data quality dimensions and concepts associated with those dimensions. The arrows indicate 
significant overlaps between concepts and also demonstrate that there is not agreement on a specific set. For 
example, the dimension of accuracy is associated with ‘agrees with real world’ and ‘match to agreed source’ 
and also to the concepts associated with validity, such as ‘derivation correct’.
