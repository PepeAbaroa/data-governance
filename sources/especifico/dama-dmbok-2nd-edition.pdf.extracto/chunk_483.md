Population of field 
is mandatory  
Count the number of 
records where data is 
populated, compare to 
the total number of 
records  
Divide the obtained number of records 
where data is populated by the total 
number of records in the table or database 
and multiply it by 100 to get to percentage 
complete 
Unacceptable: 
Below 80% 
populated 
Above 20% 
not populated 
Example 1:  
Postal Code must 
be populated in the 
address table  
Count populated: 
700,000 
Count not populated: 
300,000 
Total count: 1,000,000 
Positive measure:  
700,000/1,000,000*100 = 70% populated 
Negative measure: 
300,000/1,000,000 *100 = 30% not 
populated  
Example 
result: 
Unacceptable 
Uniqueness

only one record per

Example 2:  
There should be 
one and only one

postal code on the 
Postal Codes 
master list 
Count of duplicates:

Total Count: 1,000,000

Count of attempted 
transactions: 1,000,000

records conform to the rule 
Negative: 
(1,000,000-999,000) / 1,000,000 *100 =
